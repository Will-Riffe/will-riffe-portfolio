                Greetings,
                <br/>
                My name is Will Riffe, and this is my portfolio 
                website. It's a work in progress, and I expect 
                it'll always be so. However, it should be quite 
                presentable by 10/30/2023, if nothing else.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                I think the most time consuming process is for 
                everything to come together copacetically. The 
                challenge for my portfolio has been to get everything
                looking "complete" in its composition, and consistent
                in its theme. I'm sure it won't be everyones cup of 
                tea... however, the 'retro,' or anachronistic gui I 
                have going aims to be something which is recognizeable
                for what it is. My personal hope is that I'll feel 
                satisfied with the style for a long time too, as I'd
                really prefer to work on the content at this point.
