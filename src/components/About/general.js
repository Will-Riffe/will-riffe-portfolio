    <h2>
        Hi, I'm Will Riffeâ€” and this is my web app. 
    </h2>
    <h2>
        Coding is one of my more recently aquired skills, and I hope this portfolio site
        conveys how much I'm enjoying it! If you're here, then you're probably aware that 
        I am also open to work in software development. Currently, I work in a laboratory 
        setting, and I have a background in geology.  
    </h2>
    <h2>
        I met someone who is quite competent with technology, and she inspired me to learn
        how to code. Over the past year, I've honed my skills in languages like HTML, CSS, 
        and JavaScript, even completing the Rutgers Full Stack Coding Bootcamp through EdX 
        to learn how to tackle projects professionally and adapt to new technologies swiftly.
    </h2>
    <h2>
        Not only am I enthusiastic to keep developing this skill, which I find challenging, 
        and mentally stimulating; I am also willing to switch careers in order to do so. 
        I have found that much of the work in geology and environmental science lacks a 
        certain dynamism, and isn't so challenging when you get right down to it. software
        development, on the other hand, is actually a fresh field which is always changing,
        and I would like to dive right into it!
