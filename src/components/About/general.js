        Hi, I'm Will Riffe, and this is my web app. 
    </h2>
    <h2>
        My journey into software development has been quite an adventure: 
        Having initially pursued a passion for classical geology, I found 
        my way into the world of web development over the past year or so. I've 
        honed my skills in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, even 
        completing the Rutgers Full Stack Coding Bootcamp through EdX to learn how to 
        tackle projects professionally and adapt to new technologies swiftly.
    </h2>
    <h2>
        I'm enthusiastic about front end work, and UI design for web applications 
         it's where I currently excel. However, as you will see as you review my portfolio,
        I thrive on challenges, and I am fairly proficient with back end work as well. 
        My goal, currently, is to find work in web development, and until then I'll be 
        exercising my skills on volunteer work and pet projects.
